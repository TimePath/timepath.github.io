Some of my less polished utilities are moving to a new 'dev channel' I created. You can add the repository via this URL: `http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42745598/dev.xml`

30/06/14 Update: dropbox stopped serving directly, so the new channel is: `http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/com/timepath/launcher/config/dev.xml`
